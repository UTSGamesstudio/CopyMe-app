APP DESCRIPTION

CopyMe is a simple facial expression game designed with the aim of engaging children with varying degrees of Autism Spectrum Disorders. CopyMe requires limited literacy skills and little preparation to begin the game of mimicking onscreen facial expressions while viewing your own facial expression formation.

The creators of CopyMe are a research team from the University of Technology, Sydney. Research regarding CopyMe as a possible ASD assistive tool has led to multiple paper publications for the team, as well as motivation to provide continual improvements to the game. Please consider completing the in-App online survey to help further our research.

CopyMe is not a medical aid and should not be considered a diagnostic tool.
